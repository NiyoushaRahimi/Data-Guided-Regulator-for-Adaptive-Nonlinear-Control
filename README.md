<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
* Code will be updated
* This project is the implementation of this [paper](https://).

### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of designing a data-driven feedback controller for complex nonlinear dynamical systems in the presence of  time-varying disturbances with unknown dynamics. Such disturbances are modeled as the <b class="term">unknown</b> part of the system dynamics. The goal is to achieve finite-time regulation of system states through direct policy updates while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization or system identification. 

First, we expand upon the notion of <b class="keywords">regularizability</b> and characterize this system characteristic for a linear time-varying representation of the nonlinear system with locally-bounded higher-order terms. <b class="keywords">Rapid-regularizability</b> then gauges the extent by which a system can be regulated in finite time, in contrast to its asymptotic behavior.

We then propose the <b class="keywords">DG-RAN</b> algorithm, an online iterative synthesis procedure that utilizes discrete time-series data from a single trajectory for regulating system states and identifying disturbance dynamics. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a 6-DOF power descent guidance problem in the presence of adverse environmental disturbances.

* The quadratic funnel computed by the $\gamma$-iteration for the 6-DOF power descent problem in the presence of unmodeled time-varying disturbances. The initial condition of each test case was randomly sampled from the funnel entry, and the system uses only the offline robust controller.
