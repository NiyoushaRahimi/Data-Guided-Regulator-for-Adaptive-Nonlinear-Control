### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of designing a data-driven feedback controller for complex nonlinear dynamical systems in the presence of  time-varying disturbances with unknown dynamics. Such disturbances are modeled as the ``unknown'' part of the system dynamics. The goal is to achieve finite-time regulation of system states through direct policy updates while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization or system identification. 
First, we expand upon the notion of "regularizability" and characterize this system characteristic for a linear time-varying representation of the nonlinear system with locally-bounded higher-order terms. "Rapid-regularizability" then gauges the extent by which a system can be regulated in finite time, in contrast to its asymptotic behavior.
We then propose the DG-RAN algorithm, an online iterative synthesis procedure that utilizes discrete time-series data from a single trajectory for regulating system states and identifying disturbance dynamics. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a 6-DOF power descent guidance problem in the presence of adverse environmental disturbances.
